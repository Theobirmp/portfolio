    description: `As a front-end developer, I have experience in developing and maintaining user interfaces for web applications using HTML,
     CSS, SASS, vanilla JavaScript, React, Ionic, MUI, and Redux Toolkit. In my roles, I have collaborated with back-end developers, designers,
      and product managers to ensure seamless integration of front-end and back-end code, while meeting the needs of end-users.
       My responsibilities have included developing new features and functionality to enhance the user experience, optimizing the
        applications for speed and performance, debugging issues, resolving bugs, conducting code reviews, maintaining coding standards
         and documenting code changes and updates. I have also used agile methodologies to manage the development process, and have gained
          a strong understanding of web development best practices. Throughout my experience, I have been committed to writing clean,
           scalable code that is optimized for performance and usability.`,

    description: `I love React and its ecosystem.
      Though i don't have any work experience on the framework
       i have created many projects using React.js and relative technologies.
     I have worked with Context Api and Redux/Redux Toolkit to manage
      the state of the SPA, libraries like MUI and Tailwind to create
       rich and responsive components and animation libraries like GSAP and
     Framer Motion to bring life into my SPAs.
     I have also worked with APIs both on the front and back end.
     I have used fetch and axios to make requests to the server and
      build my own APIs with Node.js and Express.js . 
     Lastly i am familiar with databases and have some hands on
      experience with NoSQL databases like MondoDB`,
